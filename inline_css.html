        <h2>Generic Font Families</h2>
        <p>
            There are six generic font families that can be utilized for your webpage. Serif fonts include little flags at the end of letters, while sans-serif do not contain little flags. There is also cursive fonts that mimic handwriting styles, fantasy fonts that include decorative and playful styles, proportional fonts that are sized based on their letter size, and monospace fonts which distribute letter space evenly.
        </p>
        <h2>Indicating Colors</h2>
        <p>
            To indicate color on a web page or text, you can use the RGB color values to select values of red, green, and blue that each range from 0-255. Another method is to use hexadecimal colors, color codes using numbers 0-9 and letters A-F to select countless color styles. The last method is to simply use the specific color name desired for your project.
